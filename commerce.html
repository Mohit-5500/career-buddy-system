        <p>Commerce is an integral part of society. The Bachelor of Commerce explores how our desire to trade what we
            have for what we want has shaped how people and nations have interacted for millennia, and how global trade
            and digital disruption are fundamentally changing commerce in society.If you're a clever thinker who likes
            to find solutions to problems and consider ideas in abstract ways, Commerce will teach you to apply your
            thinking in a commercial capacity to influence change.

            Commerce is integral to all facets of the economy. It encompasses the diverse and rapidly changing
            activities of the world, including decision-making, leadership, innovation and policy development.
