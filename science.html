            <div class="ds">
                <p>Data Science simply is the study of different kinds of data by the application of scientific methods,
                    processes, and algorithms. As AI and machine learning, this is also one of the new-age career
                    options
                    available for science students to practice. In today’s time, data is considered the most important
                    thing
                    in an organization. Companies are relying on mining and decoding of high-quality data to implement
                    in
                    their operations.It has become a benchmark for driving growth for investors and corporates alike. A
                    mixture of computer science, math, and analytics, data science helps a professional to forecast
                    future
                    business numbers and other technical data. This can be very helpful for companies in planning future
                    operations.

                    Some industries where data science has key significance are risk management, farming, and forensics,
                    and
                    fraud management. Speaking about salary, in India an entry-level data scientist can cash in up to
                    INR
                    6-7 lakh rupees an annum, rising steeply with the accumulation of year on year experience and skill
                    development. </p>
